##JOURNAL du groupe 144 (Thomas Zaugg, Lisa Kienle) 

*************************************************

Week 1

- Setting up the working environment caused no problems (all installation issues were solved beforehand)
- Reading through the descriptions and the different files of information
- Started coding together during TP session, finished CircularBody Class and started working on different methods of Substance class
- Didn't finish during TP, so divided the work and discussed it on Friday
- Part 1 is running and passing all the tests since Friday evening

*************************************************

Week 2

- As preparation for TP2 we already read the instructions given for part 2
- Started working at 8 o'clock
- Divided the tasks (Lisa Animal House; Tom Hamster and Pellet Portion) and prepared questions to ask during TP
- Advanced well during TP
- Tried finishing on Friday, compilation problems when including the Hamsper.hpp in the Lab, waited for TP to resolve these

*************************************************

Week 3

- We set up GitHub to share our files more effectively
- We realized the problem of week 2 was due to ciruclar dependencies and we were able to solve it with the help of the TA
- We split up the work during TP: Lisa does 3.1 and Tom 3.2

*************************************************

Week 4

- We used the whole TP to debug part 3.1 and 3.2, everything working at the end of it
- Didn't do a lot of coding during this week
- Commented our code and restructured it to have it clean for the rendu intermediare
- Coded part 3.3 over the weekend

*************************************************

Week 5

- Debugged part 3.3 on Monday (Hamster was walking in Circles to target food...)
- Didn't advance well during TP (only beginning of 4.1)
- Discovered a problem with part 3 (if two hamsters are in a Lab and one dies, the program crashes)
- Solved the problem and uploaded a first version for the rendu intermediare

*************************************************

Week 6

- worked on part 4 of the project, advanced well, but had different small issues that took a lot of time to debug
- by the end of the week we nearly done with 4.3
- big issue was: we initialized the organ of a tracked hamster at the wrong place

*************************************************

Week 7

- even if the Test 22 was still not working, we were able to continue our work
- problem was then solved during the Q&A session after the TP
- divided the work of part 5 to continue individually over ascension
- started with re-reading our code
- started brainstorming possible extensions

*************************************************

Week 8

- had different bugs with part 5.1 -> debugging during TP
- but already started with part 6 since some parts are independent
- Tom finished part 5 on Thursday
- Lisa continued with 6.2
- Made a ToDo list with things to improve, revise, correct

*************************************************

Week 9

- Worked on improving the code on Monday, everything coded and compiling, but not yet running smoothly
- Only did some "light" work (planing, improving, checking) during TP, since it was directly before the exam
- Pepared all the files for the rendu
- Collected ideas for extensions and planed how to implement them
- Cheese extension successfully implemented
